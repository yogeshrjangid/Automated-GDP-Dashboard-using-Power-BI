# Automated GDP Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an automated GDP dashboard using SQL and Power BI. The primary objective is to derive insights from raw GDP data by utilizing SQL queries and visualize them through Power BI. The integration of a SQL server with Power BI, along with the use of Power Query for data transformation, enables real-time updates and seamless data processing. The project also includes the automation of the ETL process by managing SQL server jobs to ensure the continuous flow of data from Excel to Power BI.

## Features
- **Data Transformation and Querying**: SQL queries were used to extract and transform raw GDP data.
- **Power BI Visualization**: Linked the SQL server to Power BI and utilized Power Query for real-time data updates.
- **ETL Automation**: Automated the ETL process by managing SQL server jobs, ensuring continuous data flow from the source to the dashboard.

## Files in the Repository
- **gdp_dashboard.pbix**: The Power BI file containing the dashboard.
- **SQLQuery1.sql**: SQL script used to query and transform the GDP data.
- **gdp_raw_data.csv**: The raw GDP data used for the project.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Power BI Desktop**: Required to open the `.pbix` file.
- **SQL Server**: Required to execute the SQL script.

### How to Run
1. **SQL Query Execution**:
   - Execute the `SQLQuery1.sql` file on your SQL Server to prepare the data.
2. **Load the Dashboard**:
   - Open the `gdp_dashboard.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
   - Ensure the data source is correctly linked to your SQL Server.
3. **Data Refresh**:
   - If needed, refresh the data in Power BI to update the dashboard with the latest information from the SQL Server.

## Project Timeline
- **Duration**: July 2024 - August 2024
